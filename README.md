# CSCE-190

This project was created for the CSCE 190 course at USC. In this course, my group and I were tasked with creating the concept for an app and developing a high-fidelity prototype of that application; the index.html file in this repository outlines each milestone we followed in our development as part of the course.

I completed this course during my first year as a CS student.
